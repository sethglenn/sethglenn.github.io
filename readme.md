# Portfolio, Updated

## Portfolio

This is a Portfolio about me (Seth Glenn). 

It will display a few pages giving you a little personal information about me and my
interests.

There is a portfolio page displaying projects with links to code as well as the deployed applications.

Lastly, you will see a contact page showing links to my linkedIn as well as my Github profile.

The page(s) are responsive and will adapt to the users size of screen.
